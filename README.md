## Context

Hack for the Future is a 36-Hour hackathon organized by Bootup and focused on building tools that help people manage their day-to-day lives, navigate career transitions, and excel in their new careers. Think of tools that would help with time management, goal setting, productivity, continued education, and beyond. Many bootcamp graduates are going through their own career transitions and managing their own hectic lives - this hackathon was an opportunity to create innovative tools that could help bootcamp graduates.

As all the members of our group were attempting to pivot from our respective careers at the time of this hackathon, we decided to build a tool to track the job applications completed by users. Spreadsheets are an acceptable solution, but it can become difficult to keep track of status updates along with the details of each job one applies to. App-Tracker is a quality of life application which aims at helpin job seekers to better keep track of their applications and also provide them with tools to quickly apply to positions.


## Development

Back-end Technologies: Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, JWT Authentication.
Front-end Technologies: JavaScript, React.js, Bootstrap.

This application was developed on [Gitpod.io](https://www.gitpod.io/) which provides an easy-to-use developing environment.

App-Tracker runs on the [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/[) platform which allows for the app to keep running for free on the entry-level pricing tier. 
Using Gitpod.io and Heroku together allowed our team to not have to worry about running and linking a postgres database, as it was all automatically taken care of behind the scenes.

## Features

App-Tracker allows users to create a set of unique login credentials to access the application.
Once logged in, users will be able to access the dashboard and start tracking job applications by clicking the "+" button and entering all the information relevant to the job posting. 

Once added, each job application will remain on the left side of the dashboard, while the right side of the dashboard contains some tools to help job seekers keep frequently used URL's such as their Linkedin profile, Github repositories list, publically accessible resume and portfolio, and custom links.

## Challenges

Beyond the short 36 hours time frame, this hackathon presented a few challenges. Determining the scope of everyones abilities and deciding on how the project was going to be split came first. Then Team members availability was definitely an issue as this was a remote event which did not require the participants to stay in the same location. A Lack of sleep and fatigue had the biggest impact on progress during the second half of the project. 

## Future Features

If time was not a factor, the team had discussed potentially integrating external authentications to the app through various accounts (facebook,github,etc) and automated reminders. Some other features discussed were showing activity history, current count of applications, and filters to view them by.
